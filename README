RUSH Game
=================

**** Description:

This project is about a 3D platformer game. In this game, two characters (2 kids) will participate in a race to obtain an object from their master.
There will be 2 players control those 2 characters and compete with each other through network connection. 
There are multiple objects / spells on the road that player can use to take advantage.
Camera view should look like Super Mario Bros (orthogonal view) but our game is in 3D .
This project is also about deploying a server to manage profiles of players and to arrange matches between them.
We will use several external game engines / libraries for this project, such as Unity3D or libgdx.
More detail will be available later.
