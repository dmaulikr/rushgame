#RUSH Game
## Description

This project is about a 2.5D platformer game. In this game, two characters (2 kids) will participate in a race to obtain an object from their master.
There will be 2 players control those 2 characters and compete with each other through network connection. 
There are multiple objects / spells on the road that player can use to take advantage.
Camera view should look like Super Mario Bros (orthogonal view).
(This project is also about deploying a server to manage profiles of players and to arrange matches between them. - Optional)
We will use Unity3D 4.3 for this project.
